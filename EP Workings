A device that senses when an epilepsy inducing light is around

Solution - Usage of LDRs and Bluetooth along with a high resistance connected to LDR will set the range of LDR readings to low values.
When an epilepsy light is around, spikes take place due to the sudden change in the light which then warns the epileptic person via Bluetooth.

#define sw A0
void setup() {
      pinMode(sw,INPUT);
      Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  int n=analogRead(sw);
  if(n>27)
    {
          Serial.println("Epilepsy Warning");
    }
}
